# Pong

This repository implements Pong in Haskell, both as a software program
(using SDL for input and graphics) and as a hardware FPGA design via
Clash.

This code is part of the book *Retrocomputing with Clash: Haskell for
FPGA Hardware Design* at <https://unsafePerform.IO/retroclash/>.

## Building

Use `stack build` to build and `stack run pong` to run the software
version.

For the hardware version, use the included Shakefile. An easy way to
run it is via the provided `mk` shell script. Create a `build.mk` file
with content like the following:

    TARGET = nexys-a7-50t
    VIVADO_ROOT = /opt/somewhere/where/vivado/is/installed/bin
    ISE_ROOT = /opt/somewhere/where/ise/is/installed/ISE/bin/lin64
    QUARTUS_ROOT = /opt/somewhere/where/quartus/is/installed/bin
    
Alternatively, if you have Vivado/ISE installed in Docker or similar, you
can create a wrapper script and use that by setting `VIVADO` instead
of `VIVADO_ROOT`:

    TARGET = nexys-a7-50t
    VIVADO = /usr/local/lib/docker-scripts/xilinx-vivado-2019.1-ubuntu-18.04/run
    ISE = /usr/local/lib/docker-scripts/xilinx-ise-14.7-ubuntu-12.04/run
    QUARTUS = /usr/local/lib/docker-scripts/intel-quartus-20.1-ubuntu-20.04/run

## Supported target boards

* Xilinx ISE toolchain
  * Papilio One (Spartan-3) with the Arcade MegaBoard
  * Papilio Pro (Spartan-6) with the Arcade MegaBoard

* Xilinx Vivado toolchain
  * Nexys A7-50T (Artix-7)

* Intel Quartus toolchain
  * DE0-Nano (Cyclone IV) with Fen Logic VGA666 adapter
  * Arrow DECA (MAX 10)

Adding support for other Intel or Xilinx based FPGA dev boards is very
straightforward with the included Shake rules, as long as they have
VGA output and at least two input pushbuttons.

Targeting other FPGA toolchains will require adding support in the
Shake rules. Alternatively, you can always just run Clash, and import
the resulting Verilog files into your FPGA toolchain in a
non-automated way.
